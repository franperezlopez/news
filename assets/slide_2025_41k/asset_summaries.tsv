1760293954763.3547	Agentic Context Engineering Great paper on agentic context engineering. The recipe: Treat your system prompts and agent memory as a living playbook. Log trajectories, reflect to extract actionable bullets (strategies, tool schemas, failure modes), then merge as append-only deltas with periodic semantic de-dupe. Use execution signals and unit tests as supervision. Start offline to warm up a seed playbook, then continue online to self-improve. On AppWorld, ACE consistently beats strong baselines in both offline and online adaptation. Example: ReAct+ACE (offline)…
1760293954763.695	This article investigates whether using the same large language model (LLM) for both generating agent outputs and evaluating them introduces self-evaluation bias.

1760299841576.3933	The article discusses the evolution of AI agents from "Shallow Agents" (Agent 1.0) to "Deep Agents" (Agent 2.0). Shallow Agents operate using simple loops within the LLM’s context window, making them suitable for short, transactional tasks but prone to losing context and failing on complex, multi-step objectives due to overflow and lack of recovery mechanisms. Deep Agents, by contrast, use explicit planning, hierarchical delegation to specialized sub-agents, persistent external memory, and sophisticated context engineering. This architecture enables them to tackle…
1760351035742.4875	The paper introduces "Markovian Thinking" as a new paradigm for training reasoning language models using reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional RL environments for long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning make the state the entire prompt plus all reasoning tokens so far, causing the context size—and thus compute and memory costs—to grow quadratically as the reasoning length increases. Markovian Thinking instead structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks, so the model conditions only on a constant-size state, decoupling the length of reasoning from context size. At…

1760351035746.981	RIP fine-tuning ☠️ This new Stanford paper just killed it. It’s called 'Agentic Context Engineering (ACE)' and it proves you can make models smarter without touching a single weight. Instead of retraining, ACE evolves the context itself. The model writes, reflects, and edits its own prompt over and over until it becomes a self-improving system. Think of it like the model keeping a growing notebook of what works. Each failure becomes a strategy. Each success becomes a rule. The results…
1760351035747.1365	Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) is a framework designed to enhance the performance of large language model (LLM) applications by treating input contexts as evolving playbooks. Unlike traditional weight-tuning or static prompt engineering, ACE uses a modular process—generation, reflection, and curation—to incrementally refine and organize context, preventing the loss of detailed knowledge (context collapse) and mitigating brevity bias. This approach supports both offline (system prompts) and online (agent memory) adaptation, scales effectively with long-context models, and leverages natural execution feedback without…

The real breakthrough will be a conversational agent that lets you describe what you want in natural language and it builds itself. No canvas, no nodes, no workflows. That's what I'm shipping this week, if you want early access hit me up!
1760351035777.196	Some thoughts on the RL LoRA discourse, I understand this argument to be: - RL: all tokens in a sample gets a single scalar reward so O(1) - SFT: Each token computes cross entropy independently so O(tokens) This makes sense in their setup but.... https://t.co/7IjtTbBKVv
1760351035778.5046	CEO's question: What will be the hourly cost of work of a humanoid robot? Several projections have been published, e.g. by @CernBasher, @adam_dorr and @GoingBallistic5. Here's my take. I've produced a long-form video on this question (see link in comments). Here is the essence - based on very conservative assumptions (see attached image). - Production cost: $30,000. A humanoid is ~5% the mass of a passenger car. The costly parts are actuators and gearboxes; the rest is electronics, sensors, a…
1760351035778.2969	This guide introduces the **evaluation flywheel**, a structured, iterative process for building resilient prompts in AI applications. The flywheel involves three phases: **Analyze** (identify failure modes through manual annotation and coding), **Measure** (quantify failures with test datasets and automated graders), and **Improve** (refine prompts and system components based on measured results). This cycle enables continuous prompt optimization, ensuring high-quality responses across a wide range of inputs and making AI systems more robust and reliable in production. The guide also covers…

1760351035780.7522	Recent research from Thinking Machines Lab demonstrates that LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) can achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning while using only about 67% of the compute, provided it is configured correctly. The Hugging Face TRL documentation provides practical guidance and code examples for reproducing these results using both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (GRPO) tasks. Key recommendations include applying LoRA to all linear weight matrices (not just attention layers), selecting an appropriate rank for the adapter (e.g., rank 256…

The Tinker API unifies forward and backward passes, enabling seamless inference, training, and online learning through a single interface, and leverages LoRA to facilitate efficient multi-tenancy and lower infrastructure costs. SkyRL tx allows users to deploy their own Tinker-like service on their hardware, supporting batching, multi-user LoRA adapters, and efficient model updates.…
1760351035786.9104	Simon Willison introduces the concept of **vibe engineering** as a counterpart to "vibe coding"—the latter being a fast, prompt-driven, and often careless approach to using AI for software development. Vibe engineering, by contrast, refers to experienced professionals leveraging LLMs and coding agents to accelerate their work while maintaining high standards of accountability, code quality, and software engineering best practices. The article highlights how agentic coding tools like Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI have made LLMs more useful…
1760354102479.755	The paper introduces ACE (Agentic Context Engineering), a framework designed to enhance large language model (LLM) applications by treating the model context as an evolving playbook. Instead of retraining model weights, ACE incrementally updates and organizes contextual strategies through generation, reflection, and curation processes. This approach addresses issues like brevity bias and context collapse, ensuring that detailed, domain-specific knowledge is preserved and scaled efficiently for long-context LLMs. Empirically, ACE significantly outperforms strong baselines on both agent-based and domain-specific reasoning tasks,…
