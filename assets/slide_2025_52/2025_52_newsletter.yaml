          alt: Liquid AI has released LFM2, a new class of Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs) optimized for on-device generative
            AI. LFM2 features a hybrid architecture combining multiplicative gates and short convolutions, delivering up to
            2x faster CPU performance compared to Qwen3 and 3x improved training efficiency over previous models. Three dense
            checkpoints are available (350M, 700M, 1.2B parameters), and benchmarks show LFM2 outperforms similarly-sized
            models across knowledge, mathematics, instruction following, and multilingual tasks. The models excel in low-latency,
            memory-efficient deployment, making them suitable for edge devices like smartphones, laptops, and embedded systems.LFM2
            was developed using STAR, Liquid AI’s neural architecture search engine, and trained with a mix of supervised
            fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. The models are released under an open license for research and
            smaller commercial uses and are available on Hugging Face and other platforms. Enterprises can contact Liquid
            AI for commercial licensing and custom solutions, while developers can deploy and fine-tune LFM2 for private,
            local AI applications.

          alt: '**LFM2-2.6B-Exp** is an experimental checkpoint from Liquid AI, built using pure reinforcement learning on
            top of the LFM2-2.6B model. It is optimized for instruction following, knowledge tasks, and math, delivering strong
            performance relative to other models of similar size (notably outperforming much larger models on IFBench). The
            model supports eight languages and is best suited for agentic tasks, data extraction, retrieval-augmented generation
            (RAG), creative writing, and multi-turn conversations, though it is not recommended for knowledge-intensive or
            programming-heavy tasks.Technically, LFM2-2.6B-Exp uses a hybrid architecture with convolution and attention blocks,
            supports a 32,768 token context window, and was trained on a diverse, large-scale mixture of data. Recommended
            generation settings are provided, along with examples for running the model in Python using Hugging Face Transformers,
            vLLM, or llama.cpp (GGUF format). Guidance is offered for fine-tuning (SFT and DPO) using LoRA adapters and Colab
            notebooks. Tool use and structured conversation formats are supported, and the licensing is under LFM Open License
            v1.0.'

          alt: CASA is a new method for integrating visual information into large language models (LLMs). Unlike the current
            approach—which inserts image tokens directly into the text stream and can overwhelm the context window in lengthy,
            image-rich conversations—CASA offers a more efficient solution for handling multiple images, especially in streaming
            scenarios.This advancement aims to make interactions with LLMs more practical when dealing with large numbers
            of images, improving both scalability and user experience.

          alt: CASA (Cross-Attention via Self-Attention) is a novel technique for fusing visual and textual information in
            vision-language models. Unlike standard cross-attention or token insertion methods, CASA layers combine image-to-text
            cross-attention with local text-to-text self-attention within the same layer, enabling more efficient and effective
            multimodal fusion. This approach enhances performance—especially for detail-oriented tasks like document understanding
            and OCR—while retaining the computational and memory efficiency of cross-attention.Kyutai’s CASA models are evaluated
            on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional cross-attention models and
            narrowing the gap with token insertion methods. Furthermore, CASA’s design supports low-latency streaming applications,
            such as live video captioning, without the memory overhead typical of token insertion. The models and code are
            publicly available, and the technique can be flexibly integrated into new or existing vision-language architectures.

          alt: GLM 4.7 introduces a notable change in strategy for its coding endpoints by preserving its reasoning from previous
            turns, unlike other models such as Kimi K2 Thinking, DeepSeek V3.2, and MiniMax M2.1, which clear previous reasoning
            when making tool calls. This retained context allows GLM 4.7 to maintain its past thought process across interactions,
            potentially boosting performance in coding scenarios.This approach, described as "anti-context compression," provides
            the model with more information to make better decisions, though it is only applied to coding endpoints, while
            other endpoints still discard prior reasoning. The change is seen as beneficial, but it is suggested that making
            this behavior configurable would help users evaluate its actual impact.

        alt: Kling-Omni is a generalist generative framework developed by the Kling Team at Kuaishou Technology for high-fidelity
          video synthesis from multimodal visual-language inputs. Unlike traditional, fragmented approaches, Kling-Omni unifies
          video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning within a single system, supporting diverse user inputs such
          as text, images, and video contexts. The model leverages a robust data system, large-scale pre-training, and infrastructure
          optimizations to enable cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation.The report highlights ongoing
          challenges in video generation, particularly the limitations of existing models that rely on narrow, task-specific
          pipelines and static text encoders. Kling-Omni addresses these by integrating perception and creation, supporting
          multimodal in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and advanced instruction following. This positions Kling-Omni
          as a significant step toward unified multimodal world simulators capable of perceiving, reasoning, generating, and
          interacting with complex dynamic environments.

          alt: This paper introduces Self-play SWE-RL (SSR), a novel training paradigm for developing superintelligent software
            agents using large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike previous approaches that rely
            heavily on human-curated data such as GitHub issues or tests, SSR requires only access to real-world codebases
            and their dependencies. The method trains a single LLM agent to iteratively inject and repair increasingly complex
            software bugs in a self-play setting, using formal test patches rather than natural language descriptions. SSR
            demonstrates significant self-improvement and consistently outperforms baselines that use human data, even when
            evaluated on issues not seen during training.The results suggest that agents can autonomously gather extensive
            learning experiences from real-world repositories, paving the way for systems that surpass human abilities in
            understanding and creating software. The ultimate goal is to enable agents to solve novel challenges and autonomously
            develop new software from scratch, moving toward superintelligent capabilities in software engineering.

            Self-play SWE-RL (SSR) is introduced as a method for training a single large language model (LLM) agent to alternate
            between injecting bugs and repairing them, using real-world code repositories.SSR operates without relying on
            human-labeled issues or test cases, enabling scalable and realistic training for software engineering tasks. This
            approach leverages self-play to drive continuous improvement in the agent's problem-solving abilities.

        alt: This guide explains how to integrate Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) agents with modern web frontends using
          the AG-UI protocol and CopilotKit. AG-UI is an open protocol that standardizes communication between AI agents (like
          those built with ADK) and user interfaces, enabling real-time streaming of agent actions, tool usage, and state
          updates. CopilotKit provides both pre-built UI components and low-level hooks to consume these AG-UI events, simplifying
          the process of building interactive, transparent agent interfaces.The tutorial walks through wrapping a native Python
          ADK agent with the `ag_ui_adk` adapter, connecting it to a Next.js frontend via a custom API route, and using CopilotKit’s
          React context. It also demonstrates building a custom agent debugger to visualize raw AG-UI events, highlighting
          the benefits of decoupling backend logic from frontend UI and supporting real-time, event-driven user experiences.
          Key resources and implementation details are provided to help developers adopt this stack efficiently.

        alt: 'The article outlines the top five AI model optimization techniques available through NVIDIA Model Optimizer
          to enhance inference speed, reduce cost, and improve scalability for deployments on NVIDIA GPUs. The techniques
          are: (1) Post-training quantization (PTQ) for rapid model compression to lower precision with minimal effort; (2)
          Quantization-aware training (QAT), which recovers accuracy lost in quantization through targeted fine-tuning; (3)
          Quantization-aware distillation (QAD), combining QAT with knowledge distillation from a high-precision teacher for
          maximum quality at low precision; (4) Speculative decoding, which accelerates inference by proposing multiple tokens
          ahead using a draft model and verifying them in parallel, without retraining; and (5) Pruning plus knowledge distillation,
          which structurally reduces model size and then trains a smaller model to mimic the original''s behavior.Each technique
          offers distinct trade-offs in terms of implementation complexity, accuracy retention, and performance gains. They
          can be used individually or combined to maximize efficiency, throughput, and cost savings, enabling teams to better
          meet their AI deployment goals at scale.'

        alt: 'Peter Steinberger shares his experience building software at unprecedented speed using advanced AI coding agents,
          notably GPT-5.2 Codex. He describes a workflow where code generation and refactoring are mostly limited by inference
          time and conceptual thinking rather than manual labor. Steinberger highlights how trust in the models has grown—he
          rarely reads code anymore and plans features interactively through short prompts, often relying on agents to cross-reference
          and adapt existing solutions. He outlines his preferred setup, using TypeScript, Go, and Swift, automating tasks
          across devices, and leveraging custom tools like Oracle for research and troubleshooting.The post emphasizes a pragmatic,
          iterative development approach: starting with CLI tools, queuing ideas, committing directly to main, and maintaining
          simple documentation for agent context. Steinberger notes that most software is straightforward for agents, and
          modern models handle context and codebase navigation efficiently. He shares his configuration for maximizing Codex’s
          capabilities, stresses the importance of choosing well-supported dependencies, and advocates for agent-optimized
          project design. Overall, Steinberger celebrates the drastic acceleration and transformation of software development
          enabled by recent AI advances.'

          alt: Agency is described as an individual’s capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and shape their own life,
            distinguishing it from mere intelligence. While culture often venerates intelligence, agency is argued to be both
            more powerful and more scarce, making it a critical trait to hire for, educate toward, and embody at a higher
            level.Agency encompasses self-efficacy, determination, and ownership over one’s actions, differing from assertiveness
            or ambition. High-agency individuals proactively pursue goals and believe in their ability to influence outcomes,
            reflecting an internal locus of control, whereas low-agency individuals are more passive and attribute outcomes
            to external factors.
