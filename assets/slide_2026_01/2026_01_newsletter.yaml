          alt: Manus has announced that it is joining Meta, marking a major milestone for the company known for its work with
            general-purpose AI agents. Manus's AI agent has already processed over 147 trillion tokens and enabled the creation
            of more than 80 million virtual computers, demonstrating its impact in research, automation, and complex task
            execution. The company emphasizes its commitment to maintaining uninterrupted service for existing customers and
            will continue operating from Singapore.With this acquisition, Manus aims to leverage Meta’s resources to expand
            its subscription service to a much wider audience, including the vast user base on Meta’s platforms. The leadership
            at Manus assures that the core product and decision-making processes will remain unchanged, and they look forward
            to further innovating and delivering value alongside Meta.

          alt: Meta spent $72 billion building AI infrastructure without generating any direct revenue, offering free AI services
            and open-source models that failed to produce profit or satisfy investors. In contrast, a Chinese-founded startup
            named Manus launched an AI agent, rapidly reached $125 million in annual recurring revenue within eight months,
            and was acquired by Meta for $2 billion—four times its previous valuation—after demonstrating a simple, profitable
            SaaS business model.Meta's acquisition of Manus, following other major AI purchases this year, highlights its
            shift to a "pay-to-win" strategy, buying companies that have figured out how to monetize AI rather than building
            profitable products in-house. The deal involved severing Manus's Chinese ties due to geopolitical concerns, underscoring
            that the real race in AI is not just about technology, but about building businesses that make money—a challenge
            Meta has yet to solve on its own.

        alt: The paper introduces Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a new framework designed to improve upon Hyper-Connections
          (HC) in deep neural networks. HC extends traditional residual connections by widening the residual stream and diversifying
          connection patterns, which boosts performance but undermines the identity mapping property, leading to instability,
          poor scalability, and memory inefficiency.mHC addresses these issues by projecting the residual connection space
          onto a specific manifold, thereby restoring the identity mapping property and optimizing computational efficiency.
          Empirical results show that mHC enables more stable and scalable training with improved performance, making it a
          practical and flexible extension of HC. The authors suggest that mHC can inform better topological architecture
          design and advance foundational model development.

          url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24617
          alt: The paper introduces Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM), a new hierarchical language modeling framework that
            addresses inefficiencies in current Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional LLMs apply the same amount of computation
            to every token, despite the fact that language is not uniformly informative—some parts are predictable, while
            others require complex reasoning. DLCM learns to identify semantic boundaries and reallocates computational resources
            from a uniform token-level approach to a more efficient, compressed concept space, allowing for better reasoning
            and improved use of resources.DLCM does not rely on predefined linguistic units; instead, it discovers variable-length
            concepts end-to-end. The framework introduces the first compression-aware scaling law, which separates token capacity,
            concept-level reasoning capacity, and compression ratio, making compute allocation more effective under fixed
            resource constraints. Using a novel parametrization for stable training, DLCM achieves significant performance
            gains (+2.69% on average across 12 benchmarks) while keeping inference costs constant.

          alt: Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM) present a hierarchical architecture designed to improve upon traditional
            LLMs by moving beyond inefficient, uniform token-level processing. Instead of predicting the next subword token
            or a fixed number of tokens, DLCM dynamically generates the next concepts using adaptive boundaries and an end-to-end
            training approach.This dynamic and rational allocation of computational resources enables DLCM to reduce inference
            FLOPs by 34% compared to standard dense transformer architectures. The efficiency gains become more pronounced
            as model size and context length increase.

          alt: This paper systematically evaluates over 12 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for Reinforcement
            Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) on mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill models.
            The study questions the default use of LoRA, showing that structural variants like DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS consistently
            outperform it. The research also identifies a "spectral collapse" in SVD-informed methods (e.g., PiSSA, MiLoRA)
            due to misalignment between principal-component updates and RL optimization, and reveals that extreme parameter
            reduction (e.g., VeRA, Rank-1) significantly harms reasoning performance.Through ablation and scaling experiments,
            the authors provide guidance for selecting PEFT methods in RLVR, advocating for exploration beyond established
            defaults. The paper offers code (PeRL), checkpoints, and experiment logs for reproducibility and further research.

          alt: Standard LoRA is not the optimal parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for Reinforcement Learning via
            Reward (RLVR) tasks. In a large-scale evaluation using the DeepSeek-R1-Distill models on complex mathematical
            reasoning, structural variants such as DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS consistently outperform standard LoRA, with DoRA
            achieving even higher accuracy than full-parameter fine-tuning. Methods relying on SVD-based initialization (e.g.,
            PiSSA, MiLORA) suffer from performance drops or training collapse due to "spectral misalignment," as RLVR operates
            outside principal components.The study also finds that while RLVR tolerates some parameter reduction, excessive
            compression (e.g., VeRA, IA³, Rank-1 adapters) harms performance due to limited model capacity. The authors recommend
            moving beyond default LoRA usage, favoring geometry-aware adapters like DoRA, and avoiding SVD-initialized methods
            for RL tasks.

          alt: The paper introduces Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a novel inference strategy that enables large language
            models (LLMs) to process prompts far longer than their native context windows by recursively decomposing and processing
            input snippets. RLMs treat long prompts as an external environment, allowing the model to programmatically examine
            and call itself over sections of the input, thus overcoming limitations like context rot and finite context length.Empirical
            results show that RLMs can handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude larger than standard LLMs, maintaining
            strong performance even as input length and task complexity increase. Across four diverse long-context tasks,
            RLMs significantly outperform standard LLMs and common long-context methods, with comparable or lower per-query
            costs.

          alt: Recursive Language Models (RLMs) represent a significant advancement anticipated for 2026, building on the
            shift from traditional language models to reasoning models in 2025. RLMs enhance model capabilities by enabling
            them to treat their own prompts as manipulable objects within an external environment, allowing for dynamic code
            generation that invokes LLMs.A comprehensive paper detailing RLMs and presenting expanded experimental results
            is now available, offering deeper insights beyond the initial announcement made in October 2025.

        alt: Prime Intellect introduces Recursive Language Models (RLMs) as a new paradigm for handling extremely long contexts
          in LLM agents, enabling them to autonomously manage, compress, and reason over vast input data through scaffolding
          and context folding. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on external summaries or file-based scaffolding, RLMs
          leverage a persistent Python REPL and sub-LLMs to actively manipulate context, delegate tasks, and avoid information
          loss, demonstrating improved performance and efficiency in long-horizon reasoning tasks across various benchmarks
          and environments.Extensive experiments comparing RLMs to standard LLMs show that RLM scaffolding significantly boosts
          performance and token efficiency, especially in long-context and tool-intensive tasks, though results vary by domain
          and model. The article concludes that while RLMs do not universally outperform baseline models, their true potential
          will be unlocked with further reinforcement learning-based training. Future work includes deeper recursion, user-defined
          tools, multimodal support, and direct training of models to natively use the RLM framework.

        alt: '**Summary**Steve Yegge introduces "Gas Town," a new AI agent orchestrator designed to manage swarms of coding
          agents (like Claude Code and similar tools) for large-scale, high-velocity software development. Gas Town builds
          on his earlier "Beads" project (a Git-backed issue tracker) and uses a tmux-based UI to coordinate up to 20–30 agents
          simultaneously, each playing specific roles (Mayor, Polecats, Refinery, Witness, Deacon, Dogs, Crew) in a town/rig
          structure. The system centers on molecular workflows ("MEOW stack": Beads, Epics, Molecules, Protomolecules, and
          Formulas) to break down and track work, ensure durability across agent crashes, and enable continuous, autonomous
          progress—even if the process is chaotic and expensive.Yegge warns that Gas Town is experimental, complex, and intended
          only for highly advanced users already comfortable juggling multiple agent instances. Key innovations include the
          Gastown Universal Propulsion Principle (GUPP) for persistent workflow execution, "wisps" for ephemeral orchestration,
          and a plugin architecture for extensibility. Comparisons are drawn to Kubernetes and Temporal, but Gas Town focuses
          on completion rather than uptime. The project aims to redefine how coding agents collaborate, with future plans
          for federation, GUIs, and a marketplace for workflow templates.'

        alt: A group of developers humorously discuss their rapid adoption of cutting-edge AI agent orchestration tools, referencing
          fictional and real technologies like Beads, Gas Town, and advanced coding agents. They describe automating complex
          tasks—such as setting up businesses and sending messages—using a comically elaborate stack of SSH, Tailscale, Tmux,
          and multiple programming languages, with increasingly absurd levels of engineering and token consumption.The text
          satirizes the fast-paced, often convoluted nature of AI and software development, exaggerating the competition to
          push technological limits. It suggests that staying ahead requires constant innovation and massive computational
          resources, playfully warning that the field will become even more intense by 2026.

        alt: The author shares their experience experimenting with "vibe coding"—developing software with minimal direct code
          interaction—using AI agents to replicate features from the Solve-It platform as a Jupyter extension. They highlight
          the importance of providing the AI with custom testing tools and workflows, using AI to create and maintain a comprehensive
          test suite, and actively monitoring the AI's output for problematic coding patterns.Despite initial skepticism,
          the author was impressed by the rapid progress enabled by these techniques but emphasizes that this approach does
          not make SaaS (Software as a Service) obsolete. They argue that the complexity and ongoing maintenance of feature-rich
          software are better handled by dedicated teams, rather than individuals constantly managing and tuning AI-generated
          solutions.

        alt: A recent paper explores how reinforcement learning (RL) interacts with pre-training and mid-training in reasoning
          language models. It finds that RL is most beneficial when applied to data that is moderately different from the
          pre-training distribution—neither too similar nor too dissimilar.If RL is used on data very similar to the pre-training
          set, it offers minimal improvements over supervised training. Conversely, if applied to data that is too different,
          RL becomes ineffective due to insufficient model priors. The study formalizes these insights with empirical results
          and visualizations.

        alt: 'Simon Willison’s “2025: The year in LLMs” reviews major trends and milestones in the world of large language
          models (LLMs) over the past year. Key developments include the widespread adoption of “reasoning” models using Reinforcement
          Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), the practical arrival of coding and general-purpose agents, the rise of
          advanced command-line LLM tools (notably Claude Code and Codex CLI), and the normalization of high-priced AI subscriptions.
          Notably, Chinese open weight models surged to the top of benchmark charts, while local models improved but still
          lagged behind cloud-based frontier models in multi-step tasks and tool use. Other highlights include the explosion
          of prompt-driven image editing (especially Google’s “Nano Banana”), LLMs achieving gold medals in academic competitions,
          and the solidifying of “vibe coding” as a new AI-assisted workflow.The review also documents shifting leadership
          among AI labs, with OpenAI losing its clear lead to competitors like Google’s Gemini and Chinese labs, and Meta’s
          Llama losing relevance. Simon discusses evolving security concerns—such as prompt injection and the “lethal trifecta”—and
          the growing backlash against the environmental impact of data centers. He shares reflections on his own work, including
          building 110 AI-assisted tools, programming increasingly on mobile devices, and the emergence of new terminology
          like “slop” and “context rot.” The piece closes with optimism about the potential of conformance suites for new
          technologies and continued rapid innovation in the LLM space.'
