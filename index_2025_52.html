  <img alt="CASA (Cross-Attention via Self-Attention) is a novel technique for fusing visual and textual information in vision-language models. Unlike standard cross-attention or token insertion methods, CASA layers combine image-to-text cross-attention with local text-to-text self-attention within the same layer, enabling more efficient and effective multimodal fusion. This approach enhances performance—especially for detail-oriented tasks like document understanding and OCR—while retaining the computational and memory efficiency of cross-attention.Kyutai’s CASA models are evaluated on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional cross-attention models and narrowing the gap with token insertion methods. Furthermore, CASA’s design supports low-latency streaming applications, such as live video captioning, without the memory overhead typical of token insertion. The models and code are publicly available, and the technique can be flexibly integrated into new or existing vision-language architectures." class="half-size" src="assets/slide_2025_52/casa-cross-attention-via-self-attention.webp"/>

  <img alt="This paper introduces Self-play SWE-RL (SSR), a novel training paradigm for developing superintelligent software agents using large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike previous approaches that rely heavily on human-curated data such as GitHub issues or tests, SSR requires only access to real-world codebases and their dependencies. The method trains a single LLM agent to iteratively inject and repair increasingly complex software bugs in a self-play setting, using formal test patches rather than natural language descriptions. SSR demonstrates significant self-improvement and consistently outperforms baselines that use human data, even when evaluated on issues not seen during training.The results suggest that agents can autonomously gather extensive learning experiences from real-world repositories, paving the way for systems that surpass human abilities in understanding and creating software. The ultimate goal is to enable agents to solve novel challenges and autonomously develop new software from scratch, moving toward superintelligent capabilities in software engineering." src="assets/slide_2025_52/toward-training-superintelligent-software-agents-through-self-play-swe-rl-meta-uiuc-cmu.webp"/>

  <img alt="This guide explains how to integrate Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) agents with modern web frontends using the AG-UI protocol and CopilotKit. AG-UI is an open protocol that standardizes communication between AI agents (like those built with ADK) and user interfaces, enabling real-time streaming of agent actions, tool usage, and state updates. CopilotKit provides both pre-built UI components and low-level hooks to consume these AG-UI events, simplifying the process of building interactive, transparent agent interfaces.The tutorial walks through wrapping a native Python ADK agent with the `ag_ui_adk` adapter, connecting it to a Next.js frontend via a custom API route, and using CopilotKit’s React context. It also demonstrates building a custom agent debugger to visualize raw AG-UI events, highlighting the benefits of decoupling backend logic from frontend UI and supporting real-time, event-driven user experiences. Key resources and implementation details are provided to help developers adopt this stack efficiently." src="assets/slide_2025_52/integrating-google-adk-agents-with-modern-frontends-using-the-ag-ui-protocol-google.webp"/>

  <img alt="The article outlines the top five AI model optimization techniques available through NVIDIA Model Optimizer to enhance inference speed, reduce cost, and improve scalability for deployments on NVIDIA GPUs. The techniques are: (1) Post-training quantization (PTQ) for rapid model compression to lower precision with minimal effort; (2) Quantization-aware training (QAT), which recovers accuracy lost in quantization through targeted fine-tuning; (3) Quantization-aware distillation (QAD), combining QAT with knowledge distillation from a high-precision teacher for maximum quality at low precision; (4) Speculative decoding, which accelerates inference by proposing multiple tokens ahead using a draft model and verifying them in parallel, without retraining; and (5) Pruning plus knowledge distillation, which structurally reduces model size and then trains a smaller model to mimic the original's behavior.Each technique offers distinct trade-offs in terms of implementation complexity, accuracy retention, and performance gains. They can be used individually or combined to maximize efficiency, throughput, and cost savings, enabling teams to better meet their AI deployment goals at scale." src="assets/slide_2025_52/top-5-ai-model-optimization-techniques-for-faster-smarter-inference-nvidia.webp"/>

He outlines his preferred setup, using TypeScript, Go, and Swift, automating tasks across devices, and leveraging custom tools like Oracle for research and troubleshooting.The post emphasizes a pragmatic, iterative development approach: starting with CLI tools, queuing ideas, committing directly to main, and maintaining simple documentation for agent context. Steinberger notes that most software is straightforward for agents, and modern models handle context and codebase navigation efficiently. He shares his configuration for maximizing Codex’s capabilities, stresses the importance of choosing well-supported dependencies, and advocates for agent-optimized project design.
